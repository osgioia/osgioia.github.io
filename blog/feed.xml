When they asked if I knew <em>Progress</em>, I said yes — thinking they meant <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>

<p>They didn’t.<br />
It wasn’t.<br />
And that misunderstanding ended up shaping an entire chapter of my career.</p>

<p>What started as confusion became my primary development environment for years. While the tech world talked about open stacks, huge communities, and fast-moving ecosystems, I stepped into a parallel universe where almost everything revolved around a single platform, a single vendor, and a very particular way of thinking about software.</p>

<p>For a long time, I saw it as a disadvantage. Today, I see it as an uncomfortable but important part of how I grew as an engineer.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-parallel-world">The Parallel World</h2>

<p>Working with Progress OpenEdge wasn’t just using a different database or language. It meant entering a complete ecosystem — fairly closed, with its own tools, rules, and philosophy.</p>

<p>While the outside world was discussing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REST APIs</li>
  <li>microservices</li>
  <li>open-source communities</li>
  <li>stacks evolving every year</li>
</ul>

<p>I was working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ABL</li>
  <li>AppServers</li>
  <li>a database tightly coupled to the language</li>
  <li>and a much smaller, quieter community</li>
</ul>

<p>The constant feeling was being <em>outside the global tech conversation</em>. Not because we weren’t building real systems — we were — but because we were doing it on an island.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-frustration-and-what-wasnt-said">The Frustration (and What Wasn’t Said)</h2>

<p>Some things weighed heavily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation that was hard to navigate</li>
  <li>A small community to learn from</li>
  <li>Strong vendor lock-in</li>
  <li>Difficulty translating that experience into the broader job market</li>
  <li>A pace of evolution that didn’t match what was happening outside</li>
</ul>

<p>This wasn’t just a technical issue. It was professional.<br />
You felt like you were growing — but along an axis the rest of the industry barely noticed.</p>

<p>For years, I thought the problem was the technology itself.</p>

<p>Eventually, I realized it wasn’t that simple.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-uncomfortable-part-to-admit">The Uncomfortable Part to Admit</h2>

<p>ABL had good ideas.</p>

<p>It took me years to say that without resistance.</p>

<p>Statements like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FOR EACH</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FIND FIRST</code></li>
  <li>record buffers</li>
  <li>the tight integration between business logic and data access</li>
</ul>

<p>were incredibly comfortable for certain types of applications. For record-oriented business logic, they often felt more natural and expressive than writing raw SQL mixed with another language.</p>

<p>It wasn’t technical incompetence.<br />
It was a different mental model.</p>

<p>The problem wasn’t the paradigm.</p>

<p>The problem was <strong>isolation</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="it-didnt-die-for-being-useless--it-drifted-away">It Didn’t Die for Being Useless — It Drifted Away</h2>

<p>Over time, I noticed something: many technologies don’t disappear because they’re bad. They fade because they no longer belong to the ecosystem where the industry moves.</p>

<p>Progress OpenEdge became trapped in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small community</li>
  <li>strong vendor dependency</li>
  <li>limited integration with the open world</li>
  <li>difficulty evolving at the pace of the broader market</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn’t invalidate the ideas.<br />
But it does affect survival.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a technical collapse.<br />
It was an ecosystem and cultural mismatch.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-transition">The Transition</h2>

<p>When I started working with other technologies — Node, cloud platforms, modern architectures — I didn’t stop comparing everything to what I had seen in ABL.</p>

<p>But the tone changed. It wasn’t frustration anymore. It was curiosity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What if these ideas existed in an open environment?</em><br />
<em>What if a data-oriented language model wasn’t tied to a single vendor?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized something important:<br />
I didn’t want to escape what I had learned. I wanted to reinterpret it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="liteabl-not-a-replacement-but-closure">LiteABL: Not a Replacement, but Closure</h2>

<p>Building a PoC runtime inspired by ABL ideas didn’t come from anger or nostalgia. It came from technical curiosity and a personal need for closure.</p>

<p>It’s not a competitor.<br />
It’s not a replacement.<br />
It’s not a commercial product.</p>

<p>It’s a question written in code.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the experiment lives here:<br />
👉 https://github.com/osgioia/liteabl/</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Can we keep the ideas without carrying the closed ecosystem around them?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, this project isn’t the beginning of something. It’s the end of something.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="closing-a-chapter">Closing a Chapter</h2>

<p>Progress was my technical school, even when I wanted to leave it. It forced me to think differently, to understand models that weren’t trendy, to solve problems in a context I didn’t choose but that still shaped me.</p>

<p>Today, I don’t want to stay there.<br />
But I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>That misunderstanding in a 2011 interview ended up defining years of my professional life. LiteABL isn’t a rebellion against that past. It’s my way of closing the cycle while understanding everything that happened along the way.</p>

<p>Maybe the product is in decline.<br />
But the ideas were never worthless.</p>

<p>And I carried some of them with me.</p>]]></content><author><name>Oz Gioia</name></author><category term="progress" /><category term="openedge" /><category term="abl" /><category term="legacy" /><category term="software-architecture" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2011, I walked into a job interview for a developer position.

<p>Why choose one when you can have both? In this post, I’ll show you how I configured my site so that the portfolio lives at the root (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>) and the blog in a sub-path (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog</code>), using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to make the magic happen on its own.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-project-structure">The Project Structure</h2>

<p>The biggest challenge was organizing the files so they wouldn’t overlap. My structure looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── .github/workflows/   &lt;-- Where the CI/CD configuration lives
├── blog/                &lt;-- The entire Jekyll site
│   ├── _posts/
│   ├── _config.yml
│   └── index.md
├── src/                 &lt;-- React source code (living at the root)
├── public/              &lt;-- React static assets
├── package.json         &lt;-- React dependencies
└── tailwind.config.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h2 id="configuring-jekyll-for-a-sub-path">Configuring Jekyll for a Sub-path</h2>

<p>For Jekyll to know it won’t be at the root of the domain, we need to adjust the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. This is vital so that the generated file paths don’t break:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># blog/_config.yml</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">My Blog</span>
<span class="na">baseurl</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">/blog"</span> <span class="c1"># &lt;--- Vital to serve from my-domain.com/blog</span>
<span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">https://osgioia.dev"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ensures that all internal links and Jekyll CSS files are correctly served from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog/assets/...</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-magic-github-actions">The Magic: GitHub Actions</h2>

<p>This is where the real integration happens. We need a workflow that detects what changed and builds only what’s necessary.</p>

<h3 id="1-smart-change-detection">1. Smart Change Detection</h3>
<p>We don’t want to build React if we only wrote a Markdown post. We use a bash script in the workflow to detect affected directories:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Check for changes</span>
  <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">changes</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">DIFF_OUTPUT="$(git diff --name-only $ $)"</span>
    
    <span class="s">if echo "$DIFF_OUTPUT" | grep -E '^(src/|public/|package\.json)' &gt; /dev/null; then</span>
      <span class="s">echo "react_changed=true" &gt;&gt; "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>

    <span class="s">if echo "$DIFF_OUTPUT" | grep -E '^blog/' &gt; /dev/null; then</span>
      <span class="s">echo "blog_changed=true" &gt;&gt; "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="2-conditional-builds">2. Conditional Builds</h3>
<p>Then, we use that output to run build steps only when needed:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># React Build (only if frontend changed)</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build React portfolio</span>
  <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">steps.changes.outputs.react_changed == 'true'</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">npm ci</span>
    <span class="s">npm run build</span>

<span class="c1"># Jekyll Build (only if blog changed)</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build Jekyll blog</span>
  <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">steps.changes.outputs.blog_changed == 'true'</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">cd blog</span>
    <span class="s">bundle exec jekyll build --destination ../_site/blog</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="3-merging-the-sites">3. Merging the Sites</h3>
<p>The final step is to merge both results into a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder that GitHub Pages can serve:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Prepare deployment directory</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">mkdir -p _site</span>
    
    <span class="s"># Copy React build (goes to the root /)</span>
    <span class="s">if [ -d "build" ]; then</span>
      <span class="s">cp -r build/* _site/</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>

    <span class="s"># The Jekyll build was already done inside _site/blog/</span>
    <span class="s"># so the final structure is perfect.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="why-this-solution">Why This Solution?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React for UX</strong>: My landing page uses animations and dynamic components.</li>
  <li><strong>Jekyll for SEO</strong>: Blog posts are pure static HTML, perfect for indexing.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero Cost</strong>: The best part is that <strong>all of this is 100% free</strong>. GitHub Pages hosts the site at no cost, and GitHub Actions gives us free execution minutes to build the code every time we push.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funny thing is, people who say that usually forget that <strong>half the world still runs on those technologies</strong> — banks, governments, insurance systems, healthcare, all of it.<br />
And behind that code are devs who’ve been solving real-world problems for decades, keeping critical systems alive while the rest of us argue about which JavaScript framework is slightly less awful this year.</p>

<p>They’re not outdated. They’re <strong>battle-tested</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-bootcamp-paradox">The Bootcamp Paradox</h2>

<p>Nothing against bootcamps — they open doors for a lot of people.<br />
The issue is how the industry <strong>glorifies “modern stacks”</strong> while ignoring experience that actually matters.</p>

<p>A junior who knows React and a bit of Node.js might get more interviews than a dev who spent 20 years optimizing financial systems in COBOL.<br />
That’s not logic — that’s marketing.</p>

<p>And here’s the twist: the learning curve for an old-school dev picking up modern tech is usually <em>shorter</em>.<br />
They already understand logic, databases, concurrency, and performance.<br />
They’ve debugged disasters at 3 AM with no Stack Overflow link to save them.<br />
Learning a new syntax? That’s the easy part.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="reinventing-the-wheel-because-you-had-to">Reinventing the Wheel (Because You Had To)</h2>

<p>What most people don’t realize is that <strong>legacy devs had to reinvent everything</strong>.<br />
In environments like COBOL or Progress 4GL, there were no libraries, no frameworks, no “npm install something-that-solves-it-for-me”.</p>

<p>If you needed to parse a JSON file, you couldn’t just do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import json</code>.<br />
<strong>You had to build the damn parser yourself.</strong></p>

<p>That teaches a different mindset — you start thinking like an engineer, not just a code implementer.<br />
You learn to build tools, not just use them.</p>

<p>So when those same devs jump into Node.js, Go, or Python, they adapt fast — because they already understand how things work <em>under the hood</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Software changes every year, but fundamentals don’t.<br />
A dev who’s survived multiple tech eras and still stays curious is worth a lot — not for nostalgia, but for what it represents:<br />
<strong>technical resilience and adaptability.</strong></p>

<p>Those are things no bootcamp can teach in three months.</p>

<p>This blog exists mostly so I can tell myself I’m working on “content” while doing absolutely nothing about it for weeks. But hey — baby steps. At least I set up Jekyll and deployed it. That counts as productivity™.</p>
