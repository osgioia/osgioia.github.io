<p>Why choose one when you can have both? In this post, I’ll show you how I configured my site so that the portfolio lives at the root (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>) and the blog in a sub-path (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog</code>), using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> to make the magic happen on its own.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-project-structure">The Project Structure</h2>

<p>The biggest challenge was organizing the files so they wouldn’t overlap. My structure looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.
├── .github/workflows/   &lt;-- Where the CI/CD configuration lives
├── blog/                &lt;-- The entire Jekyll site
│   ├── _posts/
│   ├── _config.yml
│   └── index.md
├── src/                 &lt;-- React source code (living at the root)
├── public/              &lt;-- React static assets
├── package.json         &lt;-- React dependencies
└── tailwind.config.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />

<h2 id="configuring-jekyll-for-a-sub-path">Configuring Jekyll for a Sub-path</h2>

<p>For Jekyll to know it won’t be at the root of the domain, we need to adjust the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>. This is vital so that the generated file paths don’t break:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># blog/_config.yml</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">My Blog</span>
<span class="na">baseurl</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">/blog"</span> <span class="c1"># &lt;--- Vital to serve from my-domain.com/blog</span>
<span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">https://osgioia.dev"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This ensures that all internal links and Jekyll CSS files are correctly served from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blog/assets/...</code>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-magic-github-actions">The Magic: GitHub Actions</h2>

<p>This is where the real integration happens. We need a workflow that detects what changed and builds only what’s necessary.</p>

<h3 id="1-smart-change-detection">1. Smart Change Detection</h3>
<p>We don’t want to build React if we only wrote a Markdown post. We use a bash script in the workflow to detect affected directories:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Check for changes</span>
  <span class="na">id</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">changes</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">DIFF_OUTPUT="$(git diff --name-only $ $)"</span>
    
    <span class="s">if echo "$DIFF_OUTPUT" | grep -E '^(src/|public/|package\.json)' &gt; /dev/null; then</span>
      <span class="s">echo "react_changed=true" &gt;&gt; "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>

    <span class="s">if echo "$DIFF_OUTPUT" | grep -E '^blog/' &gt; /dev/null; then</span>
      <span class="s">echo "blog_changed=true" &gt;&gt; "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="2-conditional-builds">2. Conditional Builds</h3>
<p>Then, we use that output to run build steps only when needed:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># React Build (only if frontend changed)</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build React portfolio</span>
  <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">steps.changes.outputs.react_changed == 'true'</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">npm ci</span>
    <span class="s">npm run build</span>

<span class="c1"># Jekyll Build (only if blog changed)</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Build Jekyll blog</span>
  <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">steps.changes.outputs.blog_changed == 'true'</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">cd blog</span>
    <span class="s">bundle exec jekyll build --destination ../_site/blog</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="3-merging-the-sites">3. Merging the Sites</h3>
<p>The final step is to merge both results into a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder that GitHub Pages can serve:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Prepare deployment directory</span>
  <span class="na">run</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">|</span>
    <span class="s">mkdir -p _site</span>
    
    <span class="s"># Copy React build (goes to the root /)</span>
    <span class="s">if [ -d "build" ]; then</span>
      <span class="s">cp -r build/* _site/</span>
    <span class="s">fi</span>

    <span class="s"># The Jekyll build was already done inside _site/blog/</span>
    <span class="s"># so the final structure is perfect.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="why-this-solution">Why This Solution?</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>React for UX</strong>: My landing page uses animations and dynamic components.</li>
  <li><strong>Jekyll for SEO</strong>: Blog posts are pure static HTML, perfect for indexing.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero Cost</strong>: The best part is that <strong>all of this is 100% free</strong>. GitHub Pages hosts the site at no cost, and GitHub Actions gives us free execution minutes to build the code every time we push.</li>
</ul>

<p>Funny thing is, people who say that usually forget that <strong>half the world still runs on those technologies</strong> — banks, governments, insurance systems, healthcare, all of it.<br />
And behind that code are devs who’ve been solving real-world problems for decades, keeping critical systems alive while the rest of us argue about which JavaScript framework is slightly less awful this year.</p>

<p>They’re not outdated. They’re <strong>battle-tested</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-bootcamp-paradox">The Bootcamp Paradox</h2>

<p>Nothing against bootcamps — they open doors for a lot of people.<br />
The issue is how the industry <strong>glorifies “modern stacks”</strong> while ignoring experience that actually matters.</p>

<p>A junior who knows React and a bit of Node.js might get more interviews than a dev who spent 20 years optimizing financial systems in COBOL.<br />
That’s not logic — that’s marketing.</p>

<p>And here’s the twist: the learning curve for an old-school dev picking up modern tech is usually <em>shorter</em>.<br />
They already understand logic, databases, concurrency, and performance.<br />
They’ve debugged disasters at 3 AM with no Stack Overflow link to save them.<br />
Learning a new syntax? That’s the easy part.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="reinventing-the-wheel-because-you-had-to">Reinventing the Wheel (Because You Had To)</h2>

<p>What most people don’t realize is that <strong>legacy devs had to reinvent everything</strong>.<br />
In environments like COBOL or Progress 4GL, there were no libraries, no frameworks, no “npm install something-that-solves-it-for-me”.</p>

<p>If you needed to parse a JSON file, you couldn’t just do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import json</code>.<br />
<strong>You had to build the damn parser yourself.</strong></p>

<p>That teaches a different mindset — you start thinking like an engineer, not just a code implementer.<br />
You learn to build tools, not just use them.</p>

<p>So when those same devs jump into Node.js, Go, or Python, they adapt fast — because they already understand how things work <em>under the hood</em>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Software changes every year, but fundamentals don’t.<br />
A dev who’s survived multiple tech eras and still stays curious is worth a lot — not for nostalgia, but for what it represents:<br />
<strong>technical resilience and adaptability.</strong></p>

<p>Those are things no bootcamp can teach in three months.</p>

<p>Usually said by your friend’s indie band that’s been promising a new EP since 2019. Well… welcome to the software version of that.</p>

<p>This blog exists mostly so I can tell myself I’m working on “content” while doing absolutely nothing about it for weeks. But hey — baby steps. At least I set up Jekyll and deployed it. That counts as productivity™.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-disclaimer">A Little Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Everything I write here is <em>heavily</em> altered to protect the innocent (and the legally questionable). Names of companies, products, or people will either be changed or conveniently forgotten — not because I’m polite, but because lawsuits are expensive and I’m not AWS.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect-maybe">What To Expect (Maybe)</h2>

<p>Think of this blog as a mix of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tech stuff I found cool, confusing, or downright stupid</li>
  <li>Personal war stories from working in cloud and backend development</li>
  <li>The occasional meme in disguise as a “best practice”</li>
</ul>

<p>Will I post regularly? Who knows.<br />
Will it be useful? Probably.<br />
Will it be sarcastic? Absolutely.</p>

<p>So yeah… enjoy it. Or don’t.
