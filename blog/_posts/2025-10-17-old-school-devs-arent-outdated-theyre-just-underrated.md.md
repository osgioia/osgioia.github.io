excerpt: "Hot take: old-school devs could outlearn most bootcamp grads before lunch — and still have time to fix production."

We’ve all heard it: *“Knowing COBOL or VB6 doesn’t count anymore.”*  

Funny thing is, people who say that usually forget that **half the world still runs on those technologies** — banks, governments, insurance systems, healthcare, all of it.  
And behind that code are devs who’ve been solving real-world problems for decades, keeping critical systems alive while the rest of us argue about which JavaScript framework is slightly less awful this year.

They’re not outdated. They’re **battle-tested**.

## The Bootcamp Paradox

Nothing against bootcamps — they open doors for a lot of people.  
The issue is how the industry **glorifies “modern stacks”** while ignoring experience that actually matters.  

A junior who knows React and a bit of Node.js might get more interviews than a dev who spent 20 years optimizing financial systems in COBOL.  
That’s not logic — that’s marketing.

And here’s the twist: the learning curve for an old-school dev picking up modern tech is usually *shorter*.  
They already understand logic, databases, concurrency, and performance.  
They’ve debugged disasters at 3 AM with no Stack Overflow link to save them.  
Learning a new syntax? That’s the easy part.

## Reinventing the Wheel (Because You Had To)

What most people don’t realize is that **legacy devs had to reinvent everything**.  
In environments like COBOL or Progress 4GL, there were no libraries, no frameworks, no “npm install something-that-solves-it-for-me”.  

If you needed to parse a JSON file, you couldn’t just do `import json`.  
**You had to build the damn parser yourself.**  

That teaches a different mindset — you start thinking like an engineer, not just a code implementer.  
You learn to build tools, not just use them.  

So when those same devs jump into Node.js, Go, or Python, they adapt fast — because they already understand how things work *under the hood*.

## The Bottom Line

Software changes every year, but fundamentals don’t.  
A dev who’s survived multiple tech eras and still stays curious is worth a lot — not for nostalgia, but for what it represents:  
**technical resilience and adaptability.**

Those are things no bootcamp can teach in three months.
