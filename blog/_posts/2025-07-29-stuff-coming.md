We've all heard it: *"Big things coming soon!"*

Usually said by your friend's indie band that's been promising a new EP since 2019. Well… welcome to the software version of that.

This blog exists mostly so I can tell myself I'm working on "content" while doing absolutely nothing about it for weeks. But hey — baby steps. At least I set up Jekyll and deployed it. That counts as productivity™.

## A Little Disclaimer

Everything I write here is *heavily* altered to protect the innocent (and the legally questionable). Names of companies, products, or people will either be changed or conveniently forgotten — not because I'm polite, but because lawsuits are expensive and I'm not AWS.

## What To Expect (Maybe)

Think of this blog as a mix of:

- Tech stuff I found cool, confusing, or downright stupid
- Personal war stories from working in cloud and backend development
- The occasional meme in disguise as a "best practice"

Will I post regularly? Who knows.  
Will it be useful? Probably.  
Will it be sarcastic? Absolutely.

So yeah... enjoy it. Or don't. I'm not your manager.
