    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In 2011, I walked into a job interview for a developer position.<br />
When they asked if I knew <em>Progress</em>, I said yes — thinking they meant <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>

<p>They didn’t.<br />
It wasn’t.<br />
And that misunderstanding ended up shaping an entire chapter of my career.</p>

<p>What started as confusion became my primary development environment for years. While the tech world talked about open stacks, huge communities, and fast-moving ecosystems, I stepped into a parallel universe where almost everything revolved around a single platform, a single vendor, and a very particular way of thinking about software.</p>

<p>For a long time, I saw it as a disadvantage. Today, I see it as an uncomfortable but important part of how I grew as an engineer.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-parallel-world">The Parallel World</h2>

<p>Working with Progress OpenEdge wasn’t just using a different database or language. It meant entering a complete ecosystem — fairly closed, with its own tools, rules, and philosophy.</p>

<p>While the outside world was discussing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REST APIs</li>
  <li>microservices</li>
  <li>open-source communities</li>
  <li>stacks evolving every year</li>
</ul>

<p>I was working with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ABL</li>
  <li>AppServers</li>
  <li>a database tightly coupled to the language</li>
  <li>and a much smaller, quieter community</li>
</ul>

<p>The constant feeling was being <em>outside the global tech conversation</em>. Not because we weren’t building real systems — we were — but because we were doing it on an island.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-frustration-and-what-wasnt-said">The Frustration (and What Wasn’t Said)</h2>

<p>Some things weighed heavily:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Documentation that was hard to navigate</li>
  <li>A small community to learn from</li>
  <li>Strong vendor lock-in</li>
  <li>Difficulty translating that experience into the broader job market</li>
  <li>A pace of evolution that didn’t match what was happening outside</li>
</ul>

<p>This wasn’t just a technical issue. It was professional.<br />
You felt like you were growing — but along an axis the rest of the industry barely noticed.</p>

<p>For years, I thought the problem was the technology itself.</p>

<p>Eventually, I realized it wasn’t that simple.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-uncomfortable-part-to-admit">The Uncomfortable Part to Admit</h2>

<p>ABL had good ideas.</p>

<p>It took me years to say that without resistance.</p>

<p>Statements like:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FOR EACH</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FIND FIRST</code></li>
  <li>record buffers</li>
  <li>the tight integration between business logic and data access</li>
</ul>

<p>were incredibly comfortable for certain types of applications. For record-oriented business logic, they often felt more natural and expressive than writing raw SQL mixed with another language.</p>

<p>It wasn’t technical incompetence.<br />
It was a different mental model.</p>

<p>The problem wasn’t the paradigm.</p>

<p>The problem was <strong>isolation</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="it-didnt-die-for-being-useless--it-drifted-away">It Didn’t Die for Being Useless — It Drifted Away</h2>

<p>Over time, I noticed something: many technologies don’t disappear because they’re bad. They fade because they no longer belong to the ecosystem where the industry moves.</p>

<p>Progress OpenEdge became trapped in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a small community</li>
  <li>strong vendor dependency</li>
  <li>limited integration with the open world</li>
  <li>difficulty evolving at the pace of the broader market</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn’t invalidate the ideas.<br />
But it does affect survival.</p>

<p>This wasn’t a technical collapse.<br />
It was an ecosystem and cultural mismatch.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-transition">The Transition</h2>

<p>When I started working with other technologies — Node, cloud platforms, modern architectures — I didn’t stop comparing everything to what I had seen in ABL.</p>

<p>But the tone changed. It wasn’t frustration anymore. It was curiosity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>What if these ideas existed in an open environment?</em><br />
<em>What if a data-oriented language model wasn’t tied to a single vendor?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realized something important:<br />
I didn’t want to escape what I had learned. I wanted to reinterpret it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="liteabl-not-a-replacement-but-closure">LiteABL: Not a Replacement, but Closure</h2>

<p>Building a PoC runtime inspired by ABL ideas didn’t come from anger or nostalgia. It came from technical curiosity and a personal need for closure.</p>

<p>It’s not a competitor.<br />
It’s not a replacement.<br />
It’s not a commercial product.</p>

<p>It’s a question written in code.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the experiment lives here:<br />
👉 https://github.com/osgioia/liteabl/</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Can we keep the ideas without carrying the closed ecosystem around them?</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For me, this project isn’t the beginning of something. It’s the end of something.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="closing-a-chapter">Closing a Chapter</h2>

<p>Progress was my technical school, even when I wanted to leave it. It forced me to think differently, to understand models that weren’t trendy, to solve problems in a context I didn’t choose but that still shaped me.</p>

<p>Today, I don’t want to stay there.<br />
But I also don’t want to pretend it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>That misunderstanding in a 2011 interview ended up defining years of my professional life. LiteABL isn’t a rebellion against that past. It’s my way of closing the cycle while understanding everything that happened along the way.</p>

<p>Maybe the product is in decline.<br />
But the ideas were never worthless.</p>

<p>And I carried some of them with me.</p>
