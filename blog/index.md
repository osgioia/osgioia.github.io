Welcome to my blog! This is where I dump thoughts, random curiosities, and the occasional war story from surviving the world of software development and cloud chaos.

I write about:
- **Backend Development**:  Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and the joy of debugging something that "shouldn't be possible"
- **Cloud Technologies**: WS, Azure, GCP, and all the serverless magic that usually comes with a hidden bill  
- **DevOps**: CI/CD, infrastructure as code, automationâ€”and trying to make sense of YAML at 2AM
- **Curiosities & past experiences**: weird bugs, lessons I wish I'd learned earlier, and things that looked like a good idea at the time
